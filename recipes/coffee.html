    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The first time you set out to make French press coffee, just the sight of
      the French press coffee maker can be a little intimidating. But it's
      actually one of the simplest brewing systems, and it's been around since
      the 1850s. According to legend, its invention was actually a happy
      accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story goes that a Frenchman was boiling water when he realized he had
      forgotten to put the coffee in. He decided to add the coffee grounds to
      the boiling water nonetheless. Once the coffee grounds rose to the top, he
      used a piece of metal screen and a stick to press the screen down together
      with the grounds. The result? It was the best coffee he had ever tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite this fun origin story, the patent of the French press coffee maker
      actually came from the Italians. With time, the version has continued to
      evolve into the French press we know today â€” or a manual brewing system in
      which coffee grounds are steeped in hot water before being pressed to the
      bottom of the beaker, helping to separate the grounds from the liquid.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Whole Coffee Beans</li>
      <li>Burr Coffee Grinder</li>
      <li>Measuring Cups or Digital Food Scale</li>
      <li>French Press</li>
      <li>Boiling Water</li>
      <li>Long Spoon or stirrer</li>
      <li>Your Fav Mug!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The first step to fabulous French press coffee is to warm up the press.
        You can do this by boiling water and rinsing out the press. This will
        help maintain the temperature while brewing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, it's time to measure and grind your coffee beans. Start by
        measuring your desired amount of whole coffee beans (refer to our list
        above for general coffee:water ratios). Use a burr grinder, whether
        manual or electric, to grind whole coffee beans into coarse,
        consistently-sized grounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discard any hot water from the French press, and add the coffee grinds
        to the empty press. Bring your desired amount of water to a boil, and
        then allow it to cool for one minute. Pour the water into the French
        press.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a long spoon or stirrer, stir vigorously to break up the top
        layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow the coffee to steep for an additional four minutes. Once the timer
        goes off, gently push the plunger all the way to the bottom of the
        press. Serve immediately, although you can always store any leftover
        coffee in a thermos ($29; Amazon) to keep it warm for a while longer
        (but not too long, as it will start to get bitter as it sits).
        Congratulations! You've just made French press coffee.
